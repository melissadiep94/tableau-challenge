## Tableau Dashboard

## Dashboard #1 - this dashboard is a summary dashboard for the total # of trips
	* Visualizations: 
		1. Bar graph for the total # of trips in Sept 2018, Sept 2019, and Sept 2020
		2. Bar graph for the total # of trips by Usertype	
	* Analysis:
		* The first bar chart shows that there is a growth in total # of trips from 2018 to 2020 
		* Second bar chart shows that there are more trips with subscribers than customers

## Dashboard #2 - This dashboard shows 2 different bar chart visualizations for origin stations
	* Visualizations:
		1. Total trips by origin station in Sept 2018, Sept 2019, and Sept 2020
		2. Total trips for two origin stations (Grove St. Path and Newport Path) in Sept 2018, Sept 2019, and Sept 2020
	*Analysis:
		* The first bar chart shows that there are many different start stations for trips taken, 
		and that there is generally the same trend in each time period for most popular and least popular station.
		For example, Grove St. Path is the most popular station for each time period and 
		Leanard Gordan Park is one of the most least popular stations for each time period. 
		* The second bar chart illustrates that at the station level, not all stations increase in the # of trips at Sept 2018 vs Sept 2019 
		and Sept 2020. For example, 
			a. Exchange Place does not have any trips in Sept 2019 and Sept 2020.
			b. Grove St Path is decreasing between # of trips for Sept 2020 vs Sept 2019

## Maps - Analysis: 
	* I also created 2 map visualizations; one for the origin stations and one for the destination stations in Sept 2020. I color coded the top 10 for each map.
	* This illustrates that the same stations are listed for the most popular start and destination locations, 
	so there's a strong correlation between most popular start and end locations for Citibike trips.
